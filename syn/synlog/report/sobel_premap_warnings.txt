@W: MT529 :"/home/cli9009/ce_387/Assignments/HW4/edge_detect/sv/grayscale.sv":18:0:18:8|Found inferred clock edge_detect|clock which controls 146 sequential elements including grayscale_top_inst.grayscale_inst.gs[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
